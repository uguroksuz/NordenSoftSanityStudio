# Sections

Content types added to the index.js file in sections will appear as both `Custom section` in the page builder and a `Shared section`Â in the Studio. A Shared section can be referenced from multiple pages, hence making it possible to control content from one place.

Custom sections will be unique for the page they're added to.
